# General Notes

This document just contains notes for me to refer to during implementation.

## Assembly Language

- The destination is always the first parameter. `LD BC, nn` puts `nn` into the `BC` register pair.

## Notation in code

- In unit test methods, I've used the Cyrillic character ж to denote dereferencing since it (kinda) looks like an asterisk but is allowed in method names.
