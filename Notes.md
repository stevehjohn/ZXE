# General Notes

This document just contains notes for me to refer to during implementation.

## Assembly Language

- The destination is always the first parameter. `LD BC, nn` puts `nn` into the `BC` register pair.

## Coding Conventions

- In code the alternate registers are suffixed with `a`. E.g. `B'` is `Ba`, `C'` is `Ca` etc...
- Dereferencing registers in method names are prefixed with `addr`. E.g. `LD (BC), nn` would be called `LD_addr_BC_nn` as a C# method.
