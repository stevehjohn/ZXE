# General Notes

This document just contains notes for me to refer to during implementation.

## Assembly Language

- The destination is always the first parameter. `LD BC, nn` puts `nn` into the `BC` register pair.
- Except for some instructions, notably DDCB. E.g. `SLA (IX + d), C` stores the result of the operation on `(IX + d)` in register `C`.

## Coding Conventions

- In code the alternate registers are suffixed with `1`. E.g. `B'` is `B1`, `C'` is `C1` etc...
- Dereferencing registers in method names are prefixed with `addr`. E.g. `LD (BC), nn` would be called `LD_addr_BC_nn` as a C# method.

## Instruction sets

xx = Opcode, dd = Displacement value (byte).

- Base: `xx`
- DD: `DDxx`
- FD: `FDxx`
- ED: `EXxx`
- CB: `CBxx`
- DDCB: `DDCBddxx`
- FDCB: `FDCBddxx`

## Tests

Failing test. I think the parameters are not correct:
