# ZXE

A ZX Spectrum emulator. Mostly about just seeing if I can.

128/48 BASIC both seem to work.

A bunch of games also, see https://www.outsidecontextproblem.com/zxe-more-progress.html.

## Current tested games list

Some games require 128 emulation, some 48. Will update list to indicate this when I can.

## ZXE.Windows.Host

This will run the Spectrum emulator on Windows. For now, you'll have to edit `Program.cs` to change the version (48/128) being emulated.

Press F10 to load a Z80 file.

Planning to add a menu system or something similar to simplify this.
