# ZXE

A ZX Spectrum emulator. Mostly about just seeing if I can.

## Solution Structure

### ZXE.Core

This is the emulator. I have tried to keep all the Z80 specific code in the Z80 folder so it can be used in contexts other than only a ZX Spectrum emulator.

### ZXE.Core.Tests

Unit tests for the above.

### ZXE.Core.Tests.Console

Run some select tests in the console so the developer has easy access to the test output.
